NOTE:

JavaScript is a single-threaded programming language which means only one thing can happen at a time. That is, the JavaScript engine can only process one statement at a time in a single thread.

Synchronous code runs in sequence. This means that each operation must wait for the previous one to complete before executing. Asynchronous code runs in parallel. This means that an operation can occur while another one is still being processed.
