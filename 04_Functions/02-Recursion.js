// Recursion is a programming term that means calling a function from itself. Recursive functions can be used to solve tasks in elegant ways.When a function calls itself, thatâ€™s called a recursion step. The basis of recursion is function arguments that make the task so simple that the function does not make further calls.A recursively-defined data structure is a data structure that can be defined using itself.

function pow(x, n) {
  let result = 1;

  // multiply result by x n times in the loop
  for (let i = 0; i < n; i++) {
    result *= x;
  }
  return result;
}

console.log(pow(2, 3)); // 8

//recursive
function pow(x, n) {
  if (n == 1) {
    return x;
  } else {
    return x * pow(x, n - 1);
  }
}

console.log(pow(2, 3)); // 8

/*
When pow(x, n) is called, the execution splits into two branches:

              if n==1  = x
             /
pow(x, n) =
             \
              else     = x * pow(x, n - 1)
              
If n == 1, then everything is trivial. It is called the base of recursion, because it immediately produces the obvious result: pow(x, 1) equals x.
Otherwise, we can represent pow(x, n) as x * pow(x, n - 1). In maths, one would write xn = x * xn-1. This is called a recursive step: we transform the task into a simpler action (multiplication by x) and a simpler call of the same task (pow with lower n). Next steps simplify it further and further until n reaches 1.
