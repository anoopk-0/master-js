/*
Implicit type coercion in javascript is the automatic conversion of value from one data type to another. It takes place when the operands of an expression are of different data types.

*/

//IMP: JavaScript uses the + operator to concatenate the strings. The JavaScript interpreter works from left to right.
let x1 = 10;
let y1 = 20;
let z1 = "The result is: " + x1 + y1; //The result is: 1020 and not 30
